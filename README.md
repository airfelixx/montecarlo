# montecarlo

//
//     This is a financial risk management tool that uses Monte Carlo simulations
//     to estimate the potential future value of an investment portfolio.
//
//     The tool allows users to input their investment portfolio details, including
//     the initial investment amount, expected annual return, and volatility. It then
//     simulates the portfolio's performance over a specified number of years and
//     generates a distribution of potential future values.
//
//     This program was developed by Miguel Correia, student at the
//     Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.

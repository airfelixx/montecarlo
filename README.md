# montecarlo

//\n
//     This is a financial risk management tool that uses Monte Carlo simulations\n
//     to estimate the potential future value of an investment portfolio.\n
//\n
//     The tool allows users to input their investment portfolio details, including\n
//     the initial investment amount, expected annual return, and volatility. It then\n
//     simulates the portfolio's performance over a specified number of years and\n
//     generates a distribution of potential future values.\n
//\n
//     This program was developed by Miguel Correia, student at the\n
//     Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\n

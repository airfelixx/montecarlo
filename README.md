# Montecarlo

<br>
     This is a financial risk management tool that uses Monte Carlo simulations<br>
     to estimate the potential future value of an investment portfolio.<br>
<br>
     The tool allows users to input their investment portfolio details, including<br>
     the initial investment amount, expected annual return, and volatility. It then<br>
     simulates the portfolio's performance over a specified number of years and<br>
     generates a distribution of potential future values.<br>
<br>
     This program was developed by Miguel Correia, student at the<br>
     Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal.<br>
